## Visual Confirmation:

The navigation should have:
- Black borders (2px)
- Box shadows (4px offset)
- Bold text
- Icons for each button
- Hover effects (shadow changes)
- Neobrutalist design aesthetic

## Code Location:

The navigation implementation is in:
`/components/navigation-bar.tsx`

Lines 116-178 contain the desktop navigation implementation
Lines 219-322 contain the mobile navigation implementation

## Authentication Note:

The navigation bar shows different content based on authentication status:
- **Not logged in**: Shows "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons only
- **Logged in**: Shows full navigation with Home, My Prompts, Folders, Settings, and User menu

Make sure you're logged in to see the full navigation!
